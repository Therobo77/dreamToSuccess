        <h1>Way Towards Your Dream</h1>
        <p>It may seem daunting to look at your dreams and truly believe that you have the power to make all of them a
            reality. It takes a lot of work and even more faith to move past fear and make things happen, but it's it's
            far from impossible.</p>

                <h3>First Step Towards Goal</h3>
                <p>Setting the goal is the first step on the road to success, regardless of how difficult the
                    circumstances are. Human will is stronger than anything in this world. Learning is not only a means
                    to get a job. Learning is much more than that – it strengthens our self-confidence and enhances our
                    awareness and culture.”i!</p>

            <div class="course-col">
                <h3>Second Step Towards Goal</h3>
                <p>The second step in the decision-making process is to set your goal. A goal is what you need to
                    achieve (to have, to be, or to do) in a situation. Knowing your goal is critical to making a
                    thoughtful decision. The symbol we use for setting the goal is a target, something to aim for.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="course-col">
                <h3>Third Step Towards Goal</h3>
                <p>"A goal is essentially an objective that you either achieve or don’t achieve sometime in the future,"
                    Moore says. "A system is something you do on a regular basis that makes achieving your goal
                    inevitable. It also boosts your self-esteem because you win daily by taking regular actions toward
                    something you want." For those of you in that back, if you do something on the reg, it's a system,
                    but if it's something you're waiting to achieve at some unknown future date, it's a goal.</p>
